                From here you will be able to view and access all aspects of a case and edit/input any detail as well as be able
                to see a clear audit trail of what information has been entered when, and by who. You can see what status a section
                of the case is at, whether it is incomplete, not started or complete. There is no particular order in which a case 
                must be completed, however all sections must be complete in order to close the case.
