Although the daughter understands and agrees that her father had terminal cancer, she says it was a heart attack that caused him to die and at the time her mum just assumed all this information would be on the death certificate.  She is not happy that the MCCD does not reflect this and wants it amending to show both the cancer and heart attack.  </td>
